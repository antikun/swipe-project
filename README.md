# Project: Swipe

### Description

A "clone" of Stripe's landing page built with vanilla **HTML** and **CSS** as part of [Colt Steele's "The HTML & CESS Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/html-and-css-bootcamp/).

**Live preview:** [here](https://antikun.github.io/swipe-project/).

### Aims
Implement everything learned during the course to make a fully responsive (across all screen sizes) page with a modern look.

The markup is semantic, and the styling utilizes modern CSS features such as **custom properties**, **flexbox**, **grid**, **animations**, etc.

I added a mobile navbar menu that was not included in the project originally, so that the page would have a more finished look to it.
